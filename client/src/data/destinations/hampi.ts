    overview: [
      "Hampi, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is an ancient city that was once the capital of the magnificent Vijayanagara Empire, one of the largest and richest empires in Indian history. Spread across a surreal landscape of giant boulders, lush paddy fields, and the tranquil Tungabhadra River, Hampi's ruins tell the story of a glorious past that flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries. The city's extraordinary architecture, intricate stone carvings, and historical significance make it one of India's most fascinating archaeological sites.",
      "The ruins of Hampi are scattered over an area of nearly 26 square kilometers, comprising more than 1,600 surviving remains of palaces, temples, royal complexes, market streets, and aquatic structures. The Virupaksha Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, remains an active place of worship and is the spiritual center of Hampi. The Vittala Temple complex, with its iconic stone chariot and musical pillars, represents the pinnacle of Vijayanagara architecture and artistic achievement.",
      "Hampi's unique landscape of granite boulders and the Tungabhadra River flowing through the ruins creates a magical atmosphere that captivates historians, archaeologists, photographers, and spiritual seekers alike. The site offers a journey back in time to an era of unparalleled architectural brilliance and cultural sophistication, making it a must-visit destination for anyone interested in India's rich historical heritage."
