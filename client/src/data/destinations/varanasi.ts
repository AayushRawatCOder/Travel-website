    overview: [
      "Varanasi, also known as Kashi or Benaras, is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities and the spiritual capital of India. Situated on the banks of the sacred River Ganges, this ancient city has been a center of learning, culture, and spirituality for over 3,000 years. Varanasi is considered the holiest of the seven sacred cities in Hinduism and is a major pilgrimage site for Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains.",
      "The city's spiritual essence is most vividly experienced at the ghats - the series of stepped stone embankments along the Ganges where pilgrims perform rituals and ceremonies. The daily Ganga Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat is a spectacular spiritual spectacle that draws thousands of devotees and tourists every evening. The narrow, winding lanes of the old city are filled with temples, ashrams, and shops selling religious items, creating an atmosphere that is both chaotic and profoundly spiritual.",
      "Beyond its religious significance, Varanasi is renowned for its silk weaving, classical music, and educational institutions like the Banaras Hindu University. The city represents the continuum of Indian civilization, where ancient traditions coexist with modern life, offering visitors a transformative experience that touches the deepest aspects of human existence."
