    overview: [
      "Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, is a vibrant city that perfectly blends ancient traditions with modern urban life. Founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the city is famously known as the 'Pink City' due to the distinctive terracotta pink color of its buildings in the old city. As part of the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, Jaipur offers a magnificent glimpse into Rajasthan's royal heritage through its majestic forts, opulent palaces, and bustling markets.",
      "The city's architecture is a stunning example of Rajput and Mughal styles, with intricate carvings, beautiful courtyards, and grand facades. From the hilltop Amber Fort to the iconic Hawa Mahal and the astronomical instruments at Jantar Mantar, every monument tells a story of Jaipur's glorious past. The city's vibrant bazaars are filled with traditional handicrafts, precious gemstones, textiles, and leather goods, making it a shopper's paradise.",
      "Jaipur's rich cultural tapestry is woven with traditional music, dance, festivals, and cuisine that continue to thrive in the modern era. The city's warm hospitality, colorful streets, and royal ambiance make it one of India's most beloved destinations for experiencing the grandeur of Rajasthan's royal legacy."
