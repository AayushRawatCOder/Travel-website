    overview: [
      "Nestled in the Lesser Himalayas at an elevation of 2,042 meters, Darjeeling is a picturesque hill station renowned for its breathtaking views of the Kanchenjunga mountain range, lush tea gardens, and colonial-era architecture. Often called the 'Queen of the Hills,' this charming town has been a popular summer retreat since the British colonial era. The cool climate, stunning natural beauty, and unique cultural blend of Nepali, Tibetan, and British influences make Darjeeling one of India's most beloved hill stations.",
      "Darjeeling is synonymous with tea, producing the world-famous Darjeeling tea known for its distinctive flavor and aroma. The sprawling tea estates that carpet the hillsides offer fascinating insights into tea production and processing. The town's most iconic experience is the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site affectionately called the 'Toy Train,' which chugs through the mountains offering spectacular views of the landscape.",
      "Beyond tea and trains, Darjeeling offers numerous attractions including ancient monasteries, vibrant markets, and stunning viewpoints for sunrise over the Himalayas. The town serves as a gateway to adventure activities like trekking in the Singalila National Park and exploring the nearby border areas. Whether you're seeking tranquility, adventure, or cultural experiences, Darjeeling promises an unforgettable mountain getaway."
